## Phase 1
To run the frontend for Phase 1:

- `git clone https://github.com/csc309-winter-2020/team35/ && cd team35`
- `cd app && npm install && npm start`

Note that user and user2 represent the authorization levels of "Client" and "Trainer" respectively (as opposed to "standard" and "admin"). 

## Development
`cd app` or `cd server` then `npm install && npm start`

Or to run the app and the server in the same terminal, use `./run.sh`. If `npm install` hasn't already been run in `app/` and `server/`, use `./run.sh i` to install modules before starting.
